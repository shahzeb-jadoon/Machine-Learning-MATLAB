# Machine-Learning-MATLAB

While taking the course on Machine Learning from Stanford (on Coursera), I wanted to keep track of what I learn from the exercises I do as part of the course.
These exercises are tailored for MATLAB online which is free for the time-period of this course, so I will be utilizing this resource and won't be using Octave.
