# Machine-Learning-MATLAB

While taking the course on Maachine Learning from Stanford, I wanted to keep track of what I learn from the exercises I do as part of the course
These exercises are tailored for MATLAB online which is free for the time period of this course, so I will be utilizing this resource and won't be using Octave.
